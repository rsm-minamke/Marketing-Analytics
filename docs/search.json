While the difference is small, it’s still important to account for age to ensure unbiased analysis.\n\n\n\nBecause our outcome — number of patents — is a count variable (small integers over a fixed time frame), we model it using a Poisson distribution. We begin by estimating a simple Poisson regression via Maximum Likelihood Estimation, capturing how Blueprinty usage relates to patent output over the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nProbability Mass Function\nThe probability mass function for a single observation from a Poisson distribution is:\n\\[\nf(Y_i \\mid \\lambda) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nLikelihood Function\nAssuming the observations are independent, the likelihood function for the entire dataset is:\n\\[\nL(\\lambda; Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[\nL(\\lambda) = e^{-n\\lambda} \\cdot \\lambda^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i} \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nLog-Likelihood Function\nTaking the natural logarithm of the likelihood gives:\n\\[\n\\log L(\\lambda) = -n\\lambda + \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i \\right) \\log \\lambda - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log(Y_i!)\n\\]\nThis log-likelihood will be used to estimate ( ) via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import gammaln\n\n# Define the Poisson log-likelihood function\ndef poisson_loglikelihood(lambd, Y):\n    if lambd &lt;= 0:\n        return -np.inf  # log-likelihood is undefined for non-positive lambda\n    return np.sum(-lambd + Y * np.log(lambd) - gammaln(Y + 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visualize the Poisson log-likelihood as a function of ( ), where the maximum corresponds to the MLE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.special import gammaln\n\n# Example data: simulated Poisson observations\nY_sample = blue_df[\"patents\"].values\n\n# Range of lambda values to plot\nlambdas = np.linspace(0.1, 10, 300)\nlog_likelihoods = [poisson_loglikelihood(l, Y_sample) for l in lambdas]\n\n# Find MLE visually\nlambda_mle = lambdas[np.argmax(log_likelihoods)]\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.plot(lambdas, log_likelihoods, linewidth=2, color=\"steelblue\")\nplt.axvline(lambda_mle, color=\"darkorange\", linestyle=\"--\", label=f\"MLE ≈ {lambda_mle:.2f}\")\nplt.title(\"Poisson Log-Likelihood vs. Lambda\", fontsize=14, weight=\"bold\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Lambda\", fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel(\"Log-Likelihood\", fontsize=12)\nplt.grid(True, linestyle=\"--\", alpha=0.5)\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose ( Y_1, Y_2, , Y_n () ), where the probability mass function is:\n\\[\nf(Y_i \\mid \\lambda) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nStep 1: Log-Likelihood Function\nThe log-likelihood of the entire sample is:\n\\[\n\\log L(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( -\\lambda + Y_i \\log \\lambda - \\log Y_i! \\right)\n\\]\nWe can simplify this (since ( Y_i! ) does not depend on ( )):\n\\[\n\\log L(\\lambda) = -n\\lambda + \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i \\right) \\log \\lambda + \\text{constant}\n\\]\nStep 2: First Derivative\nTake the derivative with respect to ( ):\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\log L(\\lambda) = -n + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\n\\]\nStep 3: Set Derivative to Zero\n\\[\n-n + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = 0\n\\]\nSolving for ( ):\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = \\bar{Y}\n\\]\nThe maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of ( ) is the sample mean:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{MLE}} = \\bar{Y}\n\\]\nThis result makes intuitive sense: in a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are both equal to ( ), so the best estimate of ( ) from data is the observed average.\n\n\n\nWe use numerical optimization to find the value of ( ) that maximizes the Poisson log-likelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfrom scipy import optimize\nneg_loglikelihood = lambda lambd: -poisson_loglikelihood(lambd[0], Y_sample)\nresult = optimize.minimize(neg_loglikelihood, x0=[1.0], bounds=[(1e-6, None)])\nlambda_mle = result.x[0]\nlambda_mle\n\n\nnp.float64(3.6846667021660804)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of ( ) is approximately equal to the sample mean of the number of patents, which is expected for a Poisson distribution.\n\n\nCode\n# Compare with the sample mean\nblue_df[\"patents\"].mean()\n\n\nnp.float64(3.6846666666666668)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\). The interpretation is that the success rate of patent awards is not constant across all firms (\\(\\lambda\\)) but rather is a function of firm characteristics \\(X_i\\).

The coefficient (0.2076, p &lt; 0.001) suggests that Blueprinty users have an expected 23% more patents than similar non-users.\n\nRegional indicators (e.g., Northeast, Northwest) are not statistically significant, implying that once age and software use are controlled for, location doesn’t meaningfully affect patent outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo isolate the impact of Blueprinty, we simulate two counterfactual scenarios using the fitted Poisson model:\n\nX_0: Set iscustomer = 0 for all firms (i.e., assume no firm uses Blueprinty)\n\nX_1: Set iscustomer = 1 for all firms (i.e., assume all firms use Blueprinty)\n\nWe then predict the expected number of patents for each firm under both scenarios and compare the results. This approach highlights the causal effect of software use, holding other firm characteristics constant.\n\n\nCode\n# Make two versions of X_glm:\n# X_0: all firms are non-customers\n# X_1: all firms are customers\nX_0 = X_glm.copy()\nX_1 = X_glm.copy()\n\nX_0[\"iscustomer\"] = 0\nX_1[\"iscustomer\"] = 1\n\n# Predict expected patent counts\ny_pred_0 = glm_results.predict(X_0)\ny_pred_1 = glm_results.predict(X_1)\n\n# Estimate average treatment effect\naverage_effect = np.mean(y_pred_1 - y_pred_0)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average difference in predicted number of patents between Blueprinty customers and non-customers is:\n\n\nCode\nprint(f\"Estimated average increase in patent count from using Blueprinty: {average_effect:.3f}\")\n\n\nEstimated average increase in patent count from using Blueprinty: 0.793\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on counterfactual predictions, firms using Blueprinty’s software are expected to file approximately 0.793 more patents over a 5-year period than comparable non-users — after adjusting for age and region. This quantifies the practical impact of software adoption on innovation output."

We begin by estimating a simple Poisson regression via Maximum Likelihood Estimation, capturing how Blueprinty usage relates to patent output over the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nProbability Mass Function\nThe probability mass function for a single observation from a Poisson distribution is:\n\\[\nf(Y_i \\mid \\lambda) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nLikelihood Function\nAssuming the observations are independent, the likelihood function for the entire dataset is:\n\\[\nL(\\lambda; Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[\nL(\\lambda) = e^{-n\\lambda} \\cdot \\lambda^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i} \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nLog-Likelihood Function\nTaking the natural logarithm of the likelihood gives:\n\\[\n\\log L(\\lambda) = -n\\lambda + \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i \\right) \\log \\lambda - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log(Y_i!)\n\\]\nThis log-likelihood will be used to estimate ( ) via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import gammaln\n\n# Define the Poisson log-likelihood function\ndef poisson_loglikelihood(lambd, Y):\n    if lambd &lt;= 0:\n        return -np.inf  # log-likelihood is undefined for non-positive lambda\n    return np.sum(-lambd + Y * np.log(lambd) - gammaln(Y + 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visualize the Poisson log-likelihood as a function of ( ), where the maximum corresponds to the MLE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.special import gammaln\n\n# Example data: simulated Poisson observations\nY_sample = blue_df[\"patents\"].values\n\n# Range of lambda values to plot\nlambdas = np.linspace(0.1, 10, 300)\nlog_likelihoods = [poisson_loglikelihood(l, Y_sample) for l in lambdas]\n\n# Find MLE visually\nlambda_mle = lambdas[np.argmax(log_likelihoods)]\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.plot(lambdas, log_likelihoods, linewidth=2, color=\"steelblue\")\nplt.axvline(lambda_mle, color=\"darkorange\", linestyle=\"--\", label=f\"MLE ≈ {lambda_mle:.2f}\")\nplt.title(\"Poisson Log-Likelihood vs. Lambda\", fontsize=14, weight=\"bold\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Lambda\", fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel(\"Log-Likelihood\", fontsize=12)\nplt.grid(True, linestyle=\"--\", alpha=0.5)\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose ( Y_1, Y_2, , Y_n () ), where the probability mass function is:\n\\[\nf(Y_i \\mid \\lambda) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nStep 1: Log-Likelihood Function\nThe log-likelihood of the entire sample is:\n\\[\n\\log L(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( -\\lambda + Y_i \\log \\lambda - \\log Y_i! \\right)\n\\]\nWe can simplify this (since ( Y_i! ) does not depend on ( )):\n\\[\n\\log L(\\lambda) = -n\\lambda + \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i \\right) \\log \\lambda + \\text{constant}\n\\]\nStep 2: First Derivative\nTake the derivative with respect to ( ):\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\log L(\\lambda) = -n + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\n\\]\nStep 3: Set Derivative to Zero\n\\[\n-n + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = 0\n\\]\nSolving for ( ):\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = \\bar{Y}\n\\]\nThe maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of ( ) is the sample mean:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{MLE}} = \\bar{Y}\n\\]\nThis result makes intuitive sense: in a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are both equal to ( ), so the best estimate of ( ) from data is the observed average.\n\n\n\nWe use numerical optimization to find the value of ( ) that maximizes the Poisson log-likelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfrom scipy import optimize\nneg_loglikelihood = lambda lambd: -poisson_loglikelihood(lambd[0], Y_sample)\nresult = optimize.minimize(neg_loglikelihood, x0=[1.0], bounds=[(1e-6, None)])\nlambda_mle = result.x[0]\nlambda_mle\n\n\nnp.float64(3.6846667021660804)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of ( ) is approximately equal to the sample mean of the number of patents, which is expected for a Poisson distribution.\n\n\nCode\n# Compare with the sample mean\nblue_df[\"patents\"].mean()\n\n\nnp.float64(3.6846666666666668)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\).

The coefficient (0.2076, p &lt; 0.001) suggests that Blueprinty users have an expected 23% more patents than similar non-users.\n\nRegional indicators (e.g., Northeast, Northwest) are not statistically significant, implying that once age and software use are controlled for, location doesn’t meaningfully affect patent outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo isolate the impact of Blueprinty, we simulate two counterfactual scenarios using the fitted Poisson model:\n\nX_0: Set iscustomer = 0 for all firms (i.e., assume no firm uses Blueprinty)\n\nX_1: Set iscustomer = 1 for all firms (i.e., assume all firms use Blueprinty)\n\nWe then predict the expected number of patents for each firm under both scenarios and compare the results.

This quantifies the practical impact of software adoption on innovation output."

Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product \\(x_j\\) (eg, brand, price, etc.).\nWe model the consumer’s decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we’ll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:\n\\[ U_{ij} = x_j'\\beta + \\epsilon_{ij} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is an i.i.d. extreme value error term.\nThe choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product \\(j\\):\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(j) = \\frac{e^{x_j'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nFor example, if there are 3 products, the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product 3 is:\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{e^{x_1'\\beta} + e^{x_2'\\beta} + e^{x_3'\\beta}} \\]\nA clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer \\(i\\) is the product of the \\(J\\) probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable (\\(\\delta_{ij}\\)) that indicates the chosen product:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\\delta_{i1}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\\delta_{iJ}}\\]\nNotice that if the consumer selected product \\(j=3\\), then \\(\\delta_{i3}=1\\) while \\(\\delta_{i1}=\\delta_{i2}=0\\) and the likelihood is:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 = \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^3e^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nThe joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the \\(n\\) individual likelihoods:\n\\[ L_n(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} \\]\nAnd the joint log-likelihood function is:\n\\[ \\ell_n(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^J \\delta_{ij} \\log(\\mathbb{P}_i(j)) \\]"

As expected, posterior standard deviations are slightly larger than MLE standard errors, reflecting the integration of prior uncertainty. The credible intervals are modestly wider but substantially overlap with confidence intervals, reinforcing the consistency and reliability of the model’s insights under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks."

    "text": "6. Discussion\ntodo: Suppose you did not simulate the data. What do you observe about the parameter estimates? What does \\(\\beta_\\text{Netflix} &gt; \\beta_\\text{Prime}\\) mean? Does it make sense that \\(\\beta_\\text{price}\\) is negative?\n\nInterpreting Estimates Without Knowing the True Data-Generating Process\nIf we assume the data is from a real-world consumer choice study (not simulated), we interpret the parameter estimates based on observed patterns rather than known “true” values.\nDespite not knowing the underlying data-generating process, the model’s results appear internally consistent and economically plausible: - β_netflix &gt; β_prime indicates stronger consumer preference for Netflix over Amazon Prime. - Both brands are preferred to Hulu, the baseline. - Ads reduce utility, and higher prices deter choices — consistent with common expectations.\nThese insights align well with industry intuition and could meaningfully inform product strategy, brand positioning, and pricing decisions in digital streaming markets.\n\n\n\nSimulating Data for a Hierarchical Multinomial Logit (MNL) Model\nTo simulate data for a multi-level (hierarchical) MNL model, several key changes are required:\n\nThe standard MNL assumes all consumers share a single β vector. This is often unrealistic.\nA hierarchical model allows each respondent to have their own preferences, modeled as: [ _i (, ) ]\nWe simulate each respondent’s choices using their unique (_i), better capturing preference heterogeneity.\n\nThis structure is particularly useful for realistic conjoint data, where different users value features differently.\n\n\n\nEstimating Parameters in a Hierarchical (Random-Coefficient) Logit Model\nTo estimate such a model, we:\n\nExtract each respondent’s choice data and corresponding design matrix.\nEstimate individual-level β vectors that vary across respondents.\nUse Gibbs sampling to alternate between:\n\nSampling individual-level coefficients ((_i))\n\nSampling population-level parameters — the mean vector (()) and covariance matrix (())\n\n\nThis Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) approach allows us to: - Capture both market-level trends and individual-level variation - Generate richer, more accurate predictions - Offer deeper insights into preference heterogeneity across consumers\n\nfrom numpy.linalg import inv, cholesky\nfrom scipy.stats import invwishart, multivariate_normal\n\n# individual level data\nn_respondents = int(mnl_prep_data['id'].max())\nK = mnl_prep_data['X'].shape[1]\n\n# Group design matrix and choices by respondent\nX_groups = [mnl_prep_data['X'][mnl_prep_data['id'] == i] for i in range(1, n_respondents+1)]\ny_groups = [mnl_prep_data['y'][mnl_prep_data['id'] == i] for i in range(1, n_respondents+1)]\ntask_groups = [mnl_prep_data['task'][mnl_prep_data['id'] == i] for i in range(1, n_respondents+1)]\n\n\n# Hierarchical Priors\nmu_0 = np.zeros(K)\nSigma_0 = np.eye(K) * 10  # prior on mu\ndf = K + 2  # degrees of freedom for inverse-Wishart\nscale_matrix = np.eye(K)  # scale matrix for Sigma prior\n\n# Initialize\nmu = np.zeros(K)\nSigma = np.eye(K)\nbeta_i = np.random.randn(n_respondents, K)\n\n# Storage\ndraws_mu = []\ndraws_Sigma = []\n\n# Helper: Individual Log-likelihood\ndef individual_log_likelihood(beta, X, y, task_ids):\n    df = pd.DataFrame({'util': X @ beta, 'choice': y, 'task': task_ids})\n    df['log_denom'] = df.groupby('task')['util'].transform(lambda u: np.log(np.sum(np.exp(u))))\n    df['log_prob'] = df['choice'] * (df['util'] - df['log_denom'])\n    return df['log_prob'].sum()\n\n\n# Gibbs Sampling\nn_iter = 1000\nfor iter in range(n_iter):\n    # Step 1: Update beta_i for each respondent\n    for i in range(n_respondents):\n        X_i = X_groups[i]\n        y_i = y_groups[i]\n        task_i = task_groups[i]\n        curr_beta = beta_i[i]\n        \n        # Metropolis step (local proposal)\n        prop_beta = curr_beta + np.random.normal(scale=0.1, size=K)\n        ll_curr = individual_log_likelihood(curr_beta, X_i, y_i, task_i)\n        ll_prop = individual_log_likelihood(prop_beta, X_i, y_i, task_i)\n        \n        prior_curr = multivariate_normal.logpdf(curr_beta, mean=mu, cov=Sigma)\n        prior_prop = multivariate_normal.logpdf(prop_beta, mean=mu, cov=Sigma)\n        \n        log_accept_ratio = (ll_prop + prior_prop) - (ll_curr + prior_curr)\n        if np.log(np.random.rand()) &lt; log_accept_ratio:\n            beta_i[i] = prop_beta\n\n    # Step 2: Update mu | beta_i, Sigma\n    beta_bar = beta_i.mean(axis=0)\n    mu_cov = inv(inv(Sigma_0) + n_respondents * inv(Sigma))\n    mu_mean = mu_cov @ (inv(Sigma_0) @ mu_0 + n_respondents * inv(Sigma) @ beta_bar)\n    mu = np.random.multivariate_normal(mu_mean, mu_cov)\n\n    # Step 3: Update Sigma | beta_i, mu\n    S = np.cov((beta_i - mu).T, bias=True)\n    Sigma = invwishart.rvs(df=df + n_respondents, scale=scale_matrix + n_respondents * S)\n\n    # Store draws\n    draws_mu.append(mu)\n    draws_Sigma.append(Sigma)\n\n    if (iter + 1) % 100 == 0:\n        print(f\"Iteration {iter+1} completed.\")\n\n# Convert to DataFrames for summaries\ndraws_mu_df = pd.DataFrame(draws_mu, columns=['beta_netflix', 'beta_prime', 'beta_ads', 'beta_price'])\nprint(\"\\nPosterior means for mu:\")\nprint(draws_mu_df.mean())\n\nprint(\"\\nPosterior standard deviations for mu:\")\nprint(draws_mu_df.std())\n\nIteration 100 completed.\nIteration 200 completed.\nIteration 300 completed.\nIteration 400 completed.\nIteration 500 completed.\nIteration 600 completed.\nIteration 700 completed.\nIteration 800 completed.\nIteration 900 completed.\nIteration 1000 completed.\n\nPosterior means for mu:\nbeta_netflix    0.636826\nbeta_prime      0.243485\nbeta_ads       -0.584385\nbeta_price     -0.112804\ndtype: float64\n\nPosterior standard deviations for mu:\nbeta_netflix    0.259804\nbeta_prime      0.095506\nbeta_ads        0.283320\nbeta_price      0.035660\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting Output from the Hierarchical Bayesian Model\nThe output from the hierarchical Bayesian Multinomial Logit model summarizes the posterior distribution of the population-level means (()) for each parameter.

    "text": "Data\n\nDescription\nThe dataset comprises 50,083 observations collected from a large-scale field experiment conducted by Karlan and List (2007) to study the effect of matching grants on charitable giving. Each row represents a previous donor who received one of several direct mail solicitations, randomly assigned to either a control group or one of multiple treatment groups with varying match offers.\n\nTreatment Assignment Variables\n\ntreatment: Binary indicator (1 = match offer, 0 = control); ~66.7% of the sample received a match offer\nratio2, ratio3: Indicators for $2:$1 and $3:$1 match offers (1:1 is the reference group)\nsize25, size50, size100, sizeno: Indicators for different match cap thresholds ($25k, $50k, $100k, or unspecified)\n\n\n\nBehavioral Outcomes\n\ngave: Binary indicator of whether a donation was made\namount: Dollar amount donated\namountchange: Change in donation amount from previous gift\n\n\n\nHistorical Donor Characteristics\n\nhpa: Highest previous amount donated\nfreq: Number of prior donations\nyears: Years since first donation\nmrm2: Months since last donation\n\n\n\nDemographic and Contextual Data\n\nfemale, couple: Gender and household indicators (with ~2% missing data)\npwhite, pblack: Proportions of white and Black population in donor’s ZIP code\nmedian_hhincome: Median household income in donor’s ZIP code\npop_propurban: Proportion of population living in urban areas\n\nMost variables are clean and complete.

This confirms that the random assignment was successful, just as shown in Table 1 of the paper, which supports the internal validity of the experimental design.\n\n\nExperimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\n\n\n\nEffect of Matching Donations on Response Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ntreat_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\ntreat_df['treatment'] = treat_df['treatment'].astype(int)\n\ngrouped = treat_df.groupby('treatment')['gave'].mean().reset_index()\ngrouped['group'] = grouped['treatment'].map({0: 'Control', 1: 'Treatment'})\n\ncolors = ['#add8e6', '#00008b']   \n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nplt.bar(grouped['group'], grouped['gave'], color=colors)\nplt.ylabel('Proportion Who Donated')\nplt.title('Response Rate by Group (Treatment vs Control)')\nplt.ylim(0, 0.05)  # good for visual contrast\nplt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)\n\nfor i, val in enumerate(grouped['gave']):\n    plt.text(i, val + 0.001, f\"{val:.2%}\", ha='center', va='bottom')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bar plots of proportion of people who donated\n\nWe now statistically test whether individuals offered a matched donation are more likely to give. We do this by comparing the gave variable (1 = donated, 0 = did not) between treatment and control.\nWe use two methods:\n\nA Welch’s t-test comparing the mean of gave (i.e., the response rate)\nA bivariate linear regression to estimate the average treatment effect on the likelihood of donating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Load data\ngave_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\ngave_df['treatment'] = gave_df['treatment'].astype(int)\n\n# T-test\ntreat = gave_df[gave_df['treatment'] == 1]['gave']\ncontrol = gave_df[gave_df['treatment'] == 0]['gave']\nt_stat, t_pval = ttest_ind(treat, control, equal_var=False)\n\n# Bivariate linear regression\nmodel = smf.ols(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=gave_df).fit()\ncoef = model.params['treatment']\npval = model.pvalues['treatment']\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"====Output From the Code Block====\")\nprint(f\"\\nT-test p-value: {t_pval:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression coefficient : {coef:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression p-value: {pval:.4f}\")\n\n\n====Output From the Code Block====\n\nT-test p-value: 0.0013\nRegression coefficient : 0.0042\nRegression p-value: 0.0019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nWe find that both the t-test and the regression show this difference is statistically significant.\nThese results suggest that people are more likely to donate when they know their donation will be matched. Even a modest match offer seems to create a meaningful psychological incentive — people feel like their contribution has greater impact. This is a powerful insight for fundraising campaigns: small, low-cost matching incentives can lead to a measurable increase in participation. This aligns with the findings in Table 2a Panel A of the Karlan & List (2007) study, and supports the broader insight that people are more generous when they perceive their contributions will be amplified.\nWe now run a probit regression to test whether receiving a matching donation offer increased the probability of donating, replicating the structure of Table 3 Column 1 in Karlan & List (2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nreg_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\nreg_df['treatment'] = reg_df['treatment'].astype(int)\nreg_df['gave'] = reg_df['gave'].astype(int)\nX = sm.add_constant(reg_df['treatment'])  \ny = reg_df['gave']\n\nprobit_model = sm.Probit(y, X).fit()\n\nsummary_probit = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Coefficient': probit_model.params,\n    'Std.

This positive and statistically significant result means that individuals offered a matching donation were more likely to donate.\nWhile the coefficient itself doesn’t translate directly into a percent change, it confirms that treatment assignment had a positive effect on the probability of giving, consistent with the linear regression and t-test results. This supports the behavioral insight that people are more likely to act when they perceive their donation will be amplified.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\ncompare_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\n\ncompare_df_treat = compare_df[compare_df['treatment'] == 1].copy()\n\ncompare_df_treat['ratio_clean'] = pd.to_numeric(compare_df_treat['ratio'], errors='coerce')\n\ncompare_df_treat = compare_df_treat.dropna(subset=['ratio_clean'])\n\ngave_1_1 = compare_df_treat[compare_df_treat['ratio_clean'] == 1]['gave']\ngave_2_1 = compare_df_treat[compare_df_treat['ratio_clean'] == 2]['gave']\ngave_3_1 = compare_df_treat[compare_df_treat['ratio_clean'] == 3]['gave']\n\nt1, p1 = ttest_ind(gave_1_1, gave_2_1, equal_var=False)\nt2, p2 = ttest_ind(gave_1_1, gave_3_1, equal_var=False)\nt3, p3 = ttest_ind(gave_2_1, gave_3_1, equal_var=False)\n\nprint(\"====Output From the Code Block====\")\nprint(\"\\n1:1 vs 2:1 match - p-value:\", round(p1, 4))\nprint(\"1:1 vs 3:1 match - p-value:\", round(p2, 4))\nprint(\"2:1 vs 3:1 match - p-value:\", round(p3, 4))\n\n\n====Output From the Code Block====\n\n1:1 vs 2:1 match - p-value: 0.3345\n1:1 vs 3:1 match - p-value: 0.3101\n2:1 vs 3:1 match - p-value: 0.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nWe explored whether increasing the matching ratio for donations — from a baseline of 1:1 to higher ratios of 2:1 and 3:1 — would significantly influence the likelihood that individuals choose to donate. To investigate this, we conducted a series of t-tests comparing response rates across the different match levels. The analysis yielded the following p-values:\n1:1 vs. 2:1: p = 0.3345\n1:1 vs. 3:1: p = 0.3101\n2:1 vs. 3:1: p = 0.9600\nNone of these comparisons produced statistically significant differences, suggesting that increasing the match ratio does not lead to a corresponding increase in donation response rates.\nThese findings align with the authors’ observation on page 8 of the study, where they note that “larger match ratios do not lead to higher response rates.” In essence, while offering a match can serve as an effective behavioral nudge to encourage giving, escalating the generosity of the match—from doubling to tripling the donor’s contribution—appears to offer little to no additional persuasive power. This implies that the presence of a match itself is the critical factor in motivating donors, rather than the magnitude of the match. Thus, from a cost-efficiency standpoint, organizations might not gain much by offering higher match ratios beyond the standard 1:1.\n\n\n\n\nRegression: Response Rate by Match Ratio\nWe now use a regression to test whether larger match ratios affect the probability of donating. We create dummy variables for each ratio and regress gave on these indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nmatch_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\ndf_treat = match_df[match_df['treatment'] == 1].copy()\ndf_treat['ratio_clean'] = pd.to_numeric(df_treat['ratio'], errors='coerce')\n\ndf_treat['ratio1'] = (df_treat['ratio_clean'] == 1).astype(int)\ndf_treat['ratio2'] = (df_treat['ratio_clean'] == 2).astype(int)\ndf_treat['ratio3'] = (df_treat['ratio_clean'] == 3).astype(int)\n\nmodel = smf.ols(\"gave ~  ratio2 + ratio3\", data=df_treat).fit()\n\n# Pull only relevant output\nsummary_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Coefficient': model.params.round(6),\n    'Std.

The p-values for ratio2 and ratio3 are 0.3382 and 0.3133 respectively, which are not statistically significant, confirming that higher match ratios do not significantly affect donation likelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Mean response rate (gave) by ratio\nmeans = df_treat.groupby('ratio_clean')['gave'].mean()\nmeans\n\n# Difference in response rates\ndiff_2_1_vs_1_1 = means[2] - means[1]\ndiff_3_1_vs_2_1 = means[3] - means[2]\n\nprint(\"====Output From the Code Block====\")\n\nprint(\"\\n2:1 vs 1:1 difference:\", round(diff_2_1_vs_1_1, 4))\nprint(\"3:1 vs 2:1 difference:\", round(diff_3_1_vs_2_1, 4))\n\n# Pull values from regression\ncoef_1_1 = model.params['Intercept']\ncoef_2_1 = coef_1_1 + model.params['ratio2']\ncoef_3_1 = coef_1_1 + model.params['ratio3']\n\n# Differences\ndiff_reg_2_1_vs_1_1 = model.params['ratio2']\ndiff_reg_3_1_vs_2_1 = model.params['ratio3'] - model.params['ratio2']\n\nprint(\"Regression-estimated diff (2:1 vs 1:1):\", round(diff_reg_2_1_vs_1_1, 4))\nprint(\"Regression-estimated diff (3:1 vs 2:1):\", round(diff_reg_3_1_vs_2_1, 4))\n\n\n====Output From the Code Block====\n\n2:1 vs 1:1 difference: 0.0019\n3:1 vs 2:1 difference: 0.0001\nRegression-estimated diff (2:1 vs 1:1): 0.0019\nRegression-estimated diff (3:1 vs 2:1): 0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nTo better understand how varying match ratios influence donor behavior, we compared response rates using both raw data and estimates derived from a fitted regression model. The results were remarkably consistent across both methods.\nThe estimated difference in response rates between the 2:1 and 1:1 match ratios is approximately 0.0019, or 0.19 percentage points.\nThe difference between the 3:1 and 2:1 match ratios is even smaller — just 0.0001, or 0.01 percentage points.\nThese differences, though precisely calculated, are not statistically significant, reinforcing the conclusion that larger match ratios do not lead to meaningful increases in participation. Whether measured directly from the observed averages or inferred via regression coefficients, the effect size remains minimal.\nThis finding bolsters the claim made by the study’s authors that it is the presence of a match that matters, not its magnitude. In other words, once a match is offered — say, at a 1:1 level — increasing the match to 2:1 or 3:1 adds virtually no persuasive power. This has practical implications: organizations seeking to maximize participation may be better off using simple match offers rather than escalating the matching rate, which adds financial cost without commensurate gains in donor engagement.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn addition to analyzing whether people are more likely to donate when offered a match, we also examined whether those who do choose to give contribute larger amounts when a match is present.\nSpecifically, we assess whether individuals exposed to a matching donation (regardless of its size) contribute more money compared to those who were not offered any match at all. This analysis focuses on the size of the charitable contribution as the dependent variable.\nBy isolating this behavioral dimension — not just the decision to give, but how much to give — we can gain deeper insight into whether matching gifts serve as an incentive to amplify generosity, even if they don’t necessarily increase participation rates at higher ratios. Findings from this part of the analysis will shed light on the broader utility of match offers in charitable fundraising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Load data\nsize_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\nsize_df['treatment'] = size_df['treatment'].astype(int)\n\n# T-test on donation amount\ntreat_amt = size_df[size_df['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\ncontrol_amt = size_df[size_df['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\nt_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(treat_amt, control_amt, equal_var=False)\n\n# Regression: amount ~ treatment\nmodel_amt = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=size_df).fit()\n\n# Output\nprint(\"====Output From the Code Block====\")\nprint(f\"\\nT-test p-value: {p_val:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression coefficient (treatment effect on amount): {model_amt.params['treatment']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression p-value: {model_amt.pvalues['treatment']:.4f}\")\n\n\n====Output From the Code Block====\n\nT-test p-value: 0.0551\nRegression coefficient (treatment effect on amount): 0.1536\nRegression p-value: 0.0628\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nTo assess whether offering a matching donation influences not just whether people donate, but also how much they give, we conducted both a t-test and a bivariate linear regression comparing donation amounts between the treatment and control groups.\nThe findings show that individuals in the treatment group — those offered a match — donated $0.15 more on average than those in the control group. However, this difference does not reach statistical significance at the conventional 5% threshold, with p-values hovering around 0.06.\nWhile this result falls just short of statistical significance, it does suggest a possible trend. The effect size is small, and the p-value being close to 0.05 hints at a potential weak positive effect. Still, the current evidence is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In practical terms, this means that matching offers may slightly increase the donation amount, but this effect is subtle and not reliably distinguishable from random variation in this sample.\nThus, the results support a broader narrative: matching incentives appear to be more effective in motivating individuals to donate at all, rather than in substantially increasing the dollar amount given.\nTo gain further insight, we refine our analysis by focusing exclusively on individuals who did make a donation (gave == 1). This subset allows us to explore a different question: Among those who chose to donate, did the offer of a match lead them to contribute more money?\nWe run a regression within this restricted group to estimate the treatment effect conditional on giving. This approach helps isolate whether matching offers act as a lever to scale generosity among committed donors, as opposed to simply nudging non-donors into participation.\nThis follow-up analysis provides a more targeted view of donor behavior and may uncover subtle effects that are masked when looking at the entire sample, which includes a large proportion of non-donors. Results from this conditional regression will help clarify whether matching gifts amplify the intensity of giving among those already inclined to contribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Load data\nbehave_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\nbehave_df['treatment'] = behave_df['treatment'].astype(int)\n\n# Filter to donors only\ndf_donors = behave_df[behave_df['gave'] == 1].copy()\n\n# T-test: donation amount among donors\ntreat_amt = df_donors[df_donors['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\ncontrol_amt = df_donors[df_donors['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\nt_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(treat_amt, control_amt, equal_var=False)\n\n# Regression: amount ~ treatment (among donors only)\nmodel_donor = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df_donors).fit()\n\n# Output\nprint(\"====Output From the Code Block====\")\nprint(f\"\\nT-test p-value (donors only): {p_val:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression coefficient (treatment effect): {model_donor.params['treatment']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression p-value: {model_donor.pvalues['treatment']:.4f}\")\n\n\n====Output From the Code Block====\n\nT-test p-value (donors only): 0.5590\nRegression coefficient (treatment effect): -1.6684\nRegression p-value: 0.5615\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nTo assess whether matching offers affect how much people donate once they’ve decided to give, we restricted our analysis to individuals who actually donated (gave == 1). A linear regression estimating donation amounts showed a treatment effect of –1.67, meaning the treatment group gave slightly less than the control group. However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.5615), suggesting no meaningful effect.\nThis indicates that while matching donations increase participation, they do not increase the amount donated among those who give.\nImportantly, because this regression conditions on a post-treatment variable (giving), it breaks the original random assignment and cannot be interpreted causally. Instead, the results are descriptive — they show how average donation sizes differ across groups, but not due to treatment alone.\nWe also visualized donation amounts for treatment and control donors, marking each group’s average with a red line. The means are very similar, reinforcing the conclusion: match offers motivate people to donate, but don’t influence how much they give.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load and filter data\ndonate_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\ndonate_df = donate_df[donate_df['gave'] == 1]\ndonate_df['treatment'] = donate_df['treatment'].astype(int)\n\n# Split data\ncontrol_donors = donate_df[donate_df['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\ntreat_donors = donate_df[donate_df['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\n\n# Means\nmean_control = control_donors.mean()\nmean_treat = treat_donors.mean()\n\n# Colors\ncolors = ['#add8e6', '#00008b']  # light blue, dark blue\n\n# Plot\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8,4), sharex=False)\n\n# Control group plot\naxes[0].hist(control_donors, bins=30, color=colors[0], edgecolor='black')\naxes[0].axvline(mean_control, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Mean: ${mean_control:.2f}')\naxes[0].set_title('Control Group (Donors Only)')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Number of Donors')\naxes[0].legend()\naxes[0].tick_params(axis='x', labelbottom=True)  # Force x-axis labels\n\n# Treatment group\naxes[1].hist(treat_donors, bins=30, color=colors[1], edgecolor='black')\naxes[1].axvline(mean_treat, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Mean: ${mean_treat:.2f}')\naxes[1].set_title('Treatment Group (Donors Only)')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[1].set_ylabel('Number of Donors')\naxes[1].legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nVisualizing Donation Amounts The histograms illustrate the distribution of donation amounts among those who gave, separated by treatment and control groups. While the treatment group included more donors overall, these plots focus on how much each group gave, conditional on donating. The red dashed line represents the average donation in each group. When the means appear similar, it reinforces the idea that although the treatment boosts donation rates, it does not significantly impact gift size among those who donate.\nSimulation Experiment To reinforce how the t-statistic behaves, we run a simulation demonstrating the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nAssume:\nFor the control group (no match), donations follow a Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.018.\nFor the treatment group (any match), donations follow a Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.022.\nThis setup lets us explore how sampling variability affects the t-statistic and how, with larger samples, the estimated differences converge toward the true population values.\n\n\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Simulation setup\nnp.random.seed(42)\ncontrol_p = 0.018\ntreatment_p = 0.022\nn_draws = 10000\n\n# Simulate binary outcomes\ncontrol_draws = np.random.binomial(1, control_p, size=n_draws)\ntreatment_draws = np.random.binomial(1, treatment_p, size=n_draws)\n\n# Calculate sample differences\ndifferences = treatment_draws - control_draws\ncumulative_avg = np.cumsum(differences) / np.arange(1, n_draws + 1)\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,4))\nplt.plot(cumulative_avg, label='Cumulative Avg Difference', color='blue')\nplt.axhline(0.004, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True ATE = 0.004')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Simulated Samples')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Average Difference')\nplt.title('Law of Large Numbers: Convergence to True Treatment Effect')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nThis plot displays the cumulative average of 10,000 simulated differences between randomly sampled treatment and control responses. Initially, the average varies due to random noise, but as more samples are added, it gradually stabilizes around the true treatment effect of 0.004.\nThis illustrates the Law of Large Numbers (LLN): as the sample size grows, the sample average converges to the true population mean, reflecting the expected difference between groups. ### Central Limit Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set seed\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# True probabilities\np_control = 0.018\np_treat = 0.022\ntrue_diff = p_treat - p_control\n\n# Sample sizes to simulate\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nnum_simulations = 1000\n\n# Set up 2x2 subplot grid\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 1, figsize=(8, 10))\n# Flatten axes array for easier iteration\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    # Store average differences for each simulation\n    avg_diffs = []\n\n    for _ in range(num_simulations):\n        control = np.random.binomial(1, p_control, n)\n        treatment = np.random.binomial(1, p_treat, n)\n        avg_diffs.append(np.mean(treatment) - np.mean(control))\n    # Plot histogram\n    axes[i].hist(avg_diffs, bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')\n    axes[i].axvline(0, color='black', linestyle='--', label='Zero')\n    axes[i].axvline(true_diff, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Diff = 0.004')\n    axes[i].set_title(f\"Sample Size = {n}\")\n    axes[i].set_xlabel(\"Average Treatment Effect\")\n    axes[i].set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n    axes[i].legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nThese histograms show the sampling distribution of the difference in donation rates between treatment and control groups at different sample sizes. Each histogram is based on 1,000 simulated experiments. - At small sample sizes (e.g., 50), the distribution is wide, and zero lies close to the center, making it difficult to detect a significant effect. - As the sample size increases to 200, 500, and 1000, the distribution becomes narrower and more centered around the true effect (0.004). - By sample size 1000, zero is clearly in the tails of the distribution, showing that larger samples provide more statistical power to detect small effects."

Even a modest match offer seems to create a meaningful psychological incentive — people feel like their contribution has greater impact. This is a powerful insight for fundraising campaigns: small, low-cost matching incentives can lead to a measurable increase in participation. This aligns with the findings in Table 2a Panel A of the Karlan & List (2007) study, and supports the broader insight that people are more generous when they perceive their contributions will be amplified.\nWe now run a probit regression to test whether receiving a matching donation offer increased the probability of donating, replicating the structure of Table 3 Column 1 in Karlan & List (2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nreg_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\nreg_df['treatment'] = reg_df['treatment'].astype(int)\nreg_df['gave'] = reg_df['gave'].astype(int)\nX = sm.add_constant(reg_df['treatment'])  \ny = reg_df['gave']\n\nprobit_model = sm.Probit(y, X).fit()\n\nsummary_probit = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Coefficient': probit_model.params,\n    'Std.

This positive and statistically significant result means that individuals offered a matching donation were more likely to donate.\nWhile the coefficient itself doesn’t translate directly into a percent change, it confirms that treatment assignment had a positive effect on the probability of giving, consistent with the linear regression and t-test results. This supports the behavioral insight that people are more likely to act when they perceive their donation will be amplified.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\ncompare_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\n\ncompare_df_treat = compare_df[compare_df['treatment'] == 1].copy()\n\ncompare_df_treat['ratio_clean'] = pd.to_numeric(compare_df_treat['ratio'], errors='coerce')\n\ncompare_df_treat = compare_df_treat.dropna(subset=['ratio_clean'])\n\ngave_1_1 = compare_df_treat[compare_df_treat['ratio_clean'] == 1]['gave']\ngave_2_1 = compare_df_treat[compare_df_treat['ratio_clean'] == 2]['gave']\ngave_3_1 = compare_df_treat[compare_df_treat['ratio_clean'] == 3]['gave']\n\nt1, p1 = ttest_ind(gave_1_1, gave_2_1, equal_var=False)\nt2, p2 = ttest_ind(gave_1_1, gave_3_1, equal_var=False)\nt3, p3 = ttest_ind(gave_2_1, gave_3_1, equal_var=False)\n\nprint(\"====Output From the Code Block====\")\nprint(\"\\n1:1 vs 2:1 match - p-value:\", round(p1, 4))\nprint(\"1:1 vs 3:1 match - p-value:\", round(p2, 4))\nprint(\"2:1 vs 3:1 match - p-value:\", round(p3, 4))\n\n\n====Output From the Code Block====\n\n1:1 vs 2:1 match - p-value: 0.3345\n1:1 vs 3:1 match - p-value: 0.3101\n2:1 vs 3:1 match - p-value: 0.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nWe explored whether increasing the matching ratio for donations — from a baseline of 1:1 to higher ratios of 2:1 and 3:1 — would significantly influence the likelihood that individuals choose to donate. To investigate this, we conducted a series of t-tests comparing response rates across the different match levels. The analysis yielded the following p-values:\n1:1 vs. 2:1: p = 0.3345\n1:1 vs. 3:1: p = 0.3101\n2:1 vs. 3:1: p = 0.9600\nNone of these comparisons produced statistically significant differences, suggesting that increasing the match ratio does not lead to a corresponding increase in donation response rates.\nThese findings align with the authors’ observation on page 8 of the study, where they note that “larger match ratios do not lead to higher response rates.” In essence, while offering a match can serve as an effective behavioral nudge to encourage giving, escalating the generosity of the match—from doubling to tripling the donor’s contribution—appears to offer little to no additional persuasive power. This implies that the presence of a match itself is the critical factor in motivating donors, rather than the magnitude of the match. Thus, from a cost-efficiency standpoint, organizations might not gain much by offering higher match ratios beyond the standard 1:1."

The results were remarkably consistent across both methods.\nThe estimated difference in response rates between the 2:1 and 1:1 match ratios is approximately 0.0019, or 0.19 percentage points.\nThe difference between the 3:1 and 2:1 match ratios is even smaller — just 0.0001, or 0.01 percentage points.\nThese differences, though precisely calculated, are not statistically significant, reinforcing the conclusion that larger match ratios do not lead to meaningful increases in participation. Whether measured directly from the observed averages or inferred via regression coefficients, the effect size remains minimal.\nThis finding bolsters the claim made by the study’s authors that it is the presence of a match that matters, not its magnitude. In other words, once a match is offered — say, at a 1:1 level — increasing the match to 2:1 or 3:1 adds virtually no persuasive power. This has practical implications: organizations seeking to maximize participation may be better off using simple match offers rather than escalating the matching rate, which adds financial cost without commensurate gains in donor engagement.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn addition to analyzing whether people are more likely to donate when offered a match, we also examined whether those who do choose to give contribute larger amounts when a match is present.\nSpecifically, we assess whether individuals exposed to a matching donation (regardless of its size) contribute more money compared to those who were not offered any match at all. This analysis focuses on the size of the charitable contribution as the dependent variable.\nBy isolating this behavioral dimension — not just the decision to give, but how much to give — we can gain deeper insight into whether matching gifts serve as an incentive to amplify generosity, even if they don’t necessarily increase participation rates at higher ratios. Findings from this part of the analysis will shed light on the broader utility of match offers in charitable fundraising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Load data\nsize_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\nsize_df['treatment'] = size_df['treatment'].astype(int)\n\n# T-test on donation amount\ntreat_amt = size_df[size_df['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\ncontrol_amt = size_df[size_df['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\nt_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(treat_amt, control_amt, equal_var=False)\n\n# Regression: amount ~ treatment\nmodel_amt = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=size_df).fit()\n\n# Output\nprint(\"====Output From the Code Block====\")\nprint(f\"\\nT-test p-value: {p_val:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression coefficient (treatment effect on amount): {model_amt.params['treatment']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression p-value: {model_amt.pvalues['treatment']:.4f}\")\n\n\n====Output From the Code Block====\n\nT-test p-value: 0.0551\nRegression coefficient (treatment effect on amount): 0.1536\nRegression p-value: 0.0628\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nTo assess whether offering a matching donation influences not just whether people donate, but also how much they give, we conducted both a t-test and a bivariate linear regression comparing donation amounts between the treatment and control groups.\nThe findings show that individuals in the treatment group — those offered a match — donated $0.15 more on average than those in the control group. However, this difference does not reach statistical significance at the conventional 5% threshold, with p-values hovering around 0.06.\nWhile this result falls just short of statistical significance, it does suggest a possible trend. The effect size is small, and the p-value being close to 0.05 hints at a potential weak positive effect. Still, the current evidence is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In practical terms, this means that matching offers may slightly increase the donation amount, but this effect is subtle and not reliably distinguishable from random variation in this sample.\nThus, the results support a broader narrative: matching incentives appear to be more effective in motivating individuals to donate at all, rather than in substantially increasing the dollar amount given.\nTo gain further insight, we refine our analysis by focusing exclusively on individuals who did make a donation (gave == 1). This subset allows us to explore a different question: Among those who chose to donate, did the offer of a match lead them to contribute more money?\nWe run a regression within this restricted group to estimate the treatment effect conditional on giving. This approach helps isolate whether matching offers act as a lever to scale generosity among committed donors, as opposed to simply nudging non-donors into participation.\nThis follow-up analysis provides a more targeted view of donor behavior and may uncover subtle effects that are masked when looking at the entire sample, which includes a large proportion of non-donors. Results from this conditional regression will help clarify whether matching gifts amplify the intensity of giving among those already inclined to contribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Load data\nbehave_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\nbehave_df['treatment'] = behave_df['treatment'].astype(int)\n\n# Filter to donors only\ndf_donors = behave_df[behave_df['gave'] == 1].copy()\n\n# T-test: donation amount among donors\ntreat_amt = df_donors[df_donors['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\ncontrol_amt = df_donors[df_donors['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\nt_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(treat_amt, control_amt, equal_var=False)\n\n# Regression: amount ~ treatment (among donors only)\nmodel_donor = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df_donors).fit()\n\n# Output\nprint(\"====Output From the Code Block====\")\nprint(f\"\\nT-test p-value (donors only): {p_val:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression coefficient (treatment effect): {model_donor.params['treatment']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Regression p-value: {model_donor.pvalues['treatment']:.4f}\")\n\n\n====Output From the Code Block====\n\nT-test p-value (donors only): 0.5590\nRegression coefficient (treatment effect): -1.6684\nRegression p-value: 0.5615\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nTo assess whether matching offers affect how much people donate once they’ve decided to give, we restricted our analysis to individuals who actually donated (gave == 1). A linear regression estimating donation amounts showed a treatment effect of –1.67, meaning the treatment group gave slightly less than the control group. However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.5615), suggesting no meaningful effect.\nThis indicates that while matching donations increase participation, they do not increase the amount donated among those who give.\nImportantly, because this regression conditions on a post-treatment variable (giving), it breaks the original random assignment and cannot be interpreted causally. Instead, the results are descriptive — they show how average donation sizes differ across groups, but not due to treatment alone.\nWe also visualized donation amounts for treatment and control donors, marking each group’s average with a red line. The means are very similar, reinforcing the conclusion: match offers motivate people to donate, but don’t influence how much they give.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load and filter data\ndonate_df = pd.read_csv(\"karlan_list_2007.csv\")\ndonate_df = donate_df[donate_df['gave'] == 1]\ndonate_df['treatment'] = donate_df['treatment'].astype(int)\n\n# Split data\ncontrol_donors = donate_df[donate_df['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\ntreat_donors = donate_df[donate_df['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\n\n# Means\nmean_control = control_donors.mean()\nmean_treat = treat_donors.mean()\n\n# Colors\ncolors = ['#add8e6', '#00008b']  # light blue, dark blue\n\n# Plot\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8,4), sharex=False)\n\n# Control group plot\naxes[0].hist(control_donors, bins=30, color=colors[0], edgecolor='black')\naxes[0].axvline(mean_control, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Mean: ${mean_control:.2f}')\naxes[0].set_title('Control Group (Donors Only)')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Number of Donors')\naxes[0].legend()\naxes[0].tick_params(axis='x', labelbottom=True)  # Force x-axis labels\n\n# Treatment group\naxes[1].hist(treat_donors, bins=30, color=colors[1], edgecolor='black')\naxes[1].axvline(mean_treat, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Mean: ${mean_treat:.2f}')\naxes[1].set_title('Treatment Group (Donors Only)')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[1].set_ylabel('Number of Donors')\naxes[1].legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nVisualizing Donation Amounts The histograms illustrate the distribution of donation amounts among those who gave, separated by treatment and control groups. While the treatment group included more donors overall, these plots focus on how much each group gave, conditional on donating. The red dashed line represents the average donation in each group. When the means appear similar, it reinforces the idea that although the treatment boosts donation rates, it does not significantly impact gift size among those who donate.\nSimulation Experiment To reinforce how the t-statistic behaves, we run a simulation demonstrating the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nAssume:\nFor the control group (no match), donations follow a Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.018.\nFor the treatment group (any match), donations follow a Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.022.\nThis setup lets us explore how sampling variability affects the t-statistic and how, with larger samples, the estimated differences converge toward the true population values.\n\n\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Simulation setup\nnp.random.seed(42)\ncontrol_p = 0.018\ntreatment_p = 0.022\nn_draws = 10000\n\n# Simulate binary outcomes\ncontrol_draws = np.random.binomial(1, control_p, size=n_draws)\ntreatment_draws = np.random.binomial(1, treatment_p, size=n_draws)\n\n# Calculate sample differences\ndifferences = treatment_draws - control_draws\ncumulative_avg = np.cumsum(differences) / np.arange(1, n_draws + 1)\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,4))\nplt.plot(cumulative_avg, label='Cumulative Avg Difference', color='blue')\nplt.axhline(0.004, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True ATE = 0.004')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Simulated Samples')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Average Difference')\nplt.title('Law of Large Numbers: Convergence to True Treatment Effect')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nThis plot displays the cumulative average of 10,000 simulated differences between randomly sampled treatment and control responses. Initially, the average varies due to random noise, but as more samples are added, it gradually stabilizes around the true treatment effect of 0.004.\nThis illustrates the Law of Large Numbers (LLN): as the sample size grows, the sample average converges to the true population mean, reflecting the expected difference between groups. ### Central Limit Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set seed\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# True probabilities\np_control = 0.018\np_treat = 0.022\ntrue_diff = p_treat - p_control\n\n# Sample sizes to simulate\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nnum_simulations = 1000\n\n# Set up 2x2 subplot grid\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 1, figsize=(8, 10))\n# Flatten axes array for easier iteration\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    # Store average differences for each simulation\n    avg_diffs = []\n\n    for _ in range(num_simulations):\n        control = np.random.binomial(1, p_control, n)\n        treatment = np.random.binomial(1, p_treat, n)\n        avg_diffs.append(np.mean(treatment) - np.mean(control))\n    # Plot histogram\n    axes[i].hist(avg_diffs, bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')\n    axes[i].axvline(0, color='black', linestyle='--', label='Zero')\n    axes[i].axvline(true_diff, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Diff = 0.004')\n    axes[i].set_title(f\"Sample Size = {n}\")\n    axes[i].set_xlabel(\"Average Treatment Effect\")\n    axes[i].set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n    axes[i].legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nThese histograms show the sampling distribution of the difference in donation rates between treatment and control groups at different sample sizes. Each histogram is based on 1,000 simulated experiments. - At small sample sizes (e.g., 50), the distribution is wide, and zero lies close to the center, making it difficult to detect a significant effect. - As the sample size increases to 200, 500, and 1000, the distribution becomes narrower and more centered around the true effect (0.004). - By sample size 1000, zero is clearly in the tails of the distribution, showing that larger samples provide more statistical power to detect small effects."

    "text": "In this project, we develop and estimate a Latent Class Multinomial Logit (LC-MNL) model using data on consumer yogurt purchases. The LC-MNL model enhances the standard Multinomial Logit (MNL) approach by accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in consumer preferences. While the MNL model assumes a homogeneous population where all individuals share the same utility parameters, the LC-MNL model allows for multiple latent (hidden) classes of decision-makers, each with distinct choice behaviors.\nBy segmenting individuals into these latent classes, we can capture varying sensitivities to product attributes, such as price and promotional features, providing a richer understanding of consumer behavior.\n\n\nThe utility that individual \\(n\\) derives from choosing alternative \\(j\\) within class \\(s\\) is modeled as:\n\\[\nU_{nj}^{(s)} = X_{nj}'\\beta_s + \\varepsilon_{nj}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(X_{nj}\\) is a vector of observed attributes for alternative \\(j\\) as faced by individual \\(n\\),\n\\(\\beta_s\\) is a vector of class-specific coefficients for class \\(s\\),\n\\(\\varepsilon_{nj}\\) is an idiosyncratic error term assumed to follow an i.i.d. Gumbel distribution.\n\nEach individual has a probability \\(\\pi_s\\) of belonging to latent class \\(s\\), such that:\n\\[\n\\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\pi_s = 1\n\\]\nThe unconditional probability that individual \\(n\\) chooses alternative \\(j\\) is computed by integrating over all classes:\n\\[\nP_{nj} = \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\pi_s \\cdot \\frac{\\exp(X_{nj}'\\beta_s)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{J} \\exp(X_{nk}'\\beta_s)}\n\\]\nThis formulation allows each class to have its own set of preferences, with the class membership probabilities \\(\\pi_s\\) acting as mixture weights.\n\n\n\nTo capture unmeasured factors that systematically affect utility for certain products, we include Alternative-Specific Constants (ASCs) in our utility specification. ASCs reflect inherent preferences for each product, above and beyond observed features such as price or promotional display. The utility function becomes:\n\\[\nU_{nj} = ASC_j + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{price}_{nj} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{featured}_{nj} + \\varepsilon_{nj}\n\\]\nHere:\n\n\\(ASC_j\\) is the constant for alternative \\(j\\), omitted for one base product to avoid perfect multicollinearity,\n\\(\\text{price}_{nj}\\) is the price per ounce of the product,\n\\(\\text{featured}_{nj}\\) is a binary indicator of whether the product was on promotion.\n\nASCs capture relative preferences between products when all other observed attributes are held constant.\n\n\n\nThe yogurt dataset includes:\n\nid: An anonymized identifier for each consumer,\ny1–y4: Indicators denoting the yogurt product chosen during each purchase instance,\np1–p4: Prices of the four yogurt products (in price-per-ounce),\nf1–f4: Binary indicators for whether each product was “featured” (i.e., on promotional display) during the purchase.\n\nFor example, if a consumer with ID 1 purchased yogurt product 4 at a price of $0.079 per ounce and none of the yogurts were promoted, this would be encoded by setting y4 = 1, p4 = 0.079, and all f1 to f4 equal to 0.\nThis dataset structure allows us to analyze how consumers trade off price and promotional status when making their yogurt choices—and how these tradeoffs differ across latent segments of the population.\n\n\n\nBy estimating a latent class MNL model, we aim to:\n\nIdentify distinct consumer segments based on their price sensitivity and responsiveness to promotions,\nQuantify heterogeneity in preferences across these latent segments,\nImprove predictive performance relative to a standard MNL model by accommodating unobserved preference variation.\n\nThe next sections will cover data preprocessing, model estimation, and interpretation of results.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nyog_data = pd.read_csv('yogurt_data.csv')\nyog_data.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\np1\np2\np3\np4\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.081\n0.061\n0.079\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.064\n0.075\n\n\n2\n3\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n3\n4\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n4\n5\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.125\n0.098\n0.049\n0.079\n\n\n5\n6\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.092\n0.050\n0.079\n\n\n6\n7\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.103\n0.081\n0.049\n0.079\n\n\n7\n8\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.086\n0.054\n0.079\n\n\n8\n9\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.050\n0.079\n\n\n9\n10\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.050\n0.079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will first reshape this dataset from wide to long format\n\n## Reshape dataset \n# Reshape dataset \nyog_data = pd.wide_to_long(yog_data,\n                          stubnames=['y', 'f', 'p'],\n                          i='id',\n                          j='product',\n                          sep='',\n                          suffix='[1-4]').reset_index()\n\n# Rename columns for clarity\nyog_data = yog_data.rename(columns={\n    'y': 'chosen',\n    'f': 'featured',\n    'p': 'price'\n})\nyog_data.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nproduct\nchosen\nfeatured\nprice\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n2\n3\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n3\n4\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n4\n5\n1\n0\n0\n0.125\n\n\n5\n6\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n6\n7\n1\n0\n0\n0.103\n\n\n7\n8\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n8\n9\n1\n1\n0\n0.108\n\n\n9\n10\n1\n1\n0\n0.108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above reshaped data, each row represents a consumer–product combination with with data about if the product was chosen by the consumer, if the product was featured abd the price per ounce for that product.\n\n\n\nBefore implementing more advanced models such as Latent Class MNL, we begin by fitting a standard Multinomial Logit (MNL) model using the yogurt dataset. This serves as a useful benchmark and helps build foundational understanding of how product attributes influence consumer choices.\nTo estimate the MNL model, we use a long-format (reshaped) dataset where each row represents an alternative within a choice situation. The model will estimate the probability of each alternative being chosen, given its attributes (e.g., price and featured status).\n\n\n\nWhen using libraries such as statsmodels in Python, Alternative-Specific Constants (ASCs) are not automatically generated from categorical variables such as product identifiers. Unlike R packages (e.g., mlogit) which handle these internally, in Python we must explicitly create dummy variables to account for baseline preferences across alternatives.\nTo incorporate ASCs in our model, we perform the following steps:\n\n\nWe begin by transforming the product identifier into dummy variables using one-hot encoding. Each product is represented as a binary column indicating its presence in the current row.\nTo avoid the dummy variable trap (perfect multicollinearity), we drop one of the product columns—typically for product 1—and treat it as the reference category. The resulting dummies become proxies for ASCs. They measure how much more or less preferred each product is compared to the base alternative, after controlling for observed features like price and promotion.\nWithout ASCs, the MNL model would incorrectly assume that all products are equally attractive when their observable attributes are the same, which is often unrealistic in real-world markets.\n\n\n\nOnce the dummy variables are created, we append them to the original dataset. These columns are now part of the explanatory variables used in the MNL estimation. Together with price and featured, these product dummies allow us to model both measurable and inherent product appeal.\nThis setup results in a model specification of the form:\n\\[\nU_{nj} = ASC_j + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{price}_{nj} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{featured}_{nj} + \\varepsilon_{nj}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(ASC_j\\) is the dummy variable for product \\(j\\) (excluding the base category),\n\\(\\text{price}_{nj}\\) is the price per ounce of alternative \\(j\\) for individual \\(n\\),\n\\(\\text{featured}_{nj}\\) is a binary variable indicating whether the product was on promotion.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we present the Python code that performs these steps—generating one-hot encoded product variables and merging them with the dataset.

heterogeneity in the population. Rather than arbitrarily choosing a number of classes, we systematically estimate models with varying class counts—typically 2, 3, 4, and 5—and compare them using a formal model selection criterion.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate and compare the fitted models, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), a widely used metric that balances goodness-of-fit with model complexity. The BIC for a model is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nBIC = -2 \\cdot \\ell_n + k \\cdot \\log(n)\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n( _n ) is the log-likelihood of the model evaluated at convergence,\n( n ) is the number of observations in the dataset,\n( k ) is the total number of estimated parameters in the model.\n\nThe BIC penalizes models for having a large number of parameters, discouraging overfitting. While models with more classes typically achieve higher log-likelihood values, this improvement must be large enough to offset the BIC penalty incurred by additional complexity.\n\n\n\nIn LC-MNL models, each additional latent class introduces:\n\nA new set of class-specific utility parameters (e.g., price and promotion coefficients),\nAn additional class probability parameter (subject to a sum-to-one constraint).\n\nAs a result, the parameter count grows quickly with each added class. Although this flexibility may enhance model fit, it can also lead to overfitting, particularly if some latent classes capture noise rather than meaningful segments of behavior.\nThe BIC is specifically designed to mitigate this risk. It rewards models that strike a good balance between fit and simplicity. A lower BIC value indicates a better model, with the preferred number of classes being the one that minimizes the BIC across all candidate models.\n\n\n\nThe typical workflow for selecting the optimal number of latent classes is as follows:\n\nEstimate LC-MNL models for 2, 3, 4, and 5 classes using maximum likelihood estimation.\nCompute BIC for each model using the formula above.\nCompare BIC values across models to identify the lowest score.\nSelect the model with the minimum BIC as the optimal latent class solution.\n\nThis procedure provides a principled way to uncover meaningful consumer segments without relying on arbitrary assumptions about how many classes exist.\nThe following section will walk through the estimation and comparison process using actual yogurt purchase data.\n\nresults = []\nfor K in range(2, 6):\n    print(f\"Estimating model for {K} classes...\")\n    res = lc_mnl(K, yog_data)\n    results.append(res)\n    #print(f\"Estimated parameters for K = {K}:\")\n    #print(res[\"Parameters\"])\n\nbic = pd.DataFrame(results).sort_values(by='BIC')\n\nEstimating model for 2 classes...\nEstimating model for 3 classes...\nEstimating model for 4 classes...\nEstimating model for 5 classes...\n\n\n\nbic[['K', 'LogLikelihood', 'NumParams', 'BIC']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\nLogLikelihood\nNumParams\nBIC\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\n-8802.938460\n29\n17831.950671\n\n\n1\n3\n-8941.863060\n17\n18016.252112\n\n\n2\n4\n-9530.346287\n23\n19239.992444\n\n\n0\n2\n-10505.614448\n11\n21096.981007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model with the lowest BIC is selected as the best-fitting model when balancing accuracy and simplicity. In our results, the 3-class model had the lowest BIC, suggesting that it best explains the data while avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\n\nNow we compare the parameter estimates between (1) the aggregate MNL, and (2) the latent-class MNL with the number of classes suggested by the BIC.\n\nlc_mnl_3class_params = results[[res[\"K\"] for res in results].index(3)][\"Parameters\"].reset_index()\nlc_mnl_3class_params.columns\nclass3_params = lc_mnl_3class_params.loc[lc_mnl_3class_params['index'].str.contains('_class3')]\nprint(\"Class 3 parameter estimates\")\nprint(class3_params)\n\nClass 3 parameter estimates\n             index        Value  Active bound  Rob.

It reveals that, on average, consumers display moderate sensitivity to price and a positive response to promotional features. However, this summary masks the diverse and nuanced preferences that exist across individuals.\nIn contrast, the Latent Class MNL (LC-MNL) model, particularly with three latent classes, reveals substantial heterogeneity in how consumers make trade-offs:\n\nClass 1 closely mirrors the behavior identified in the aggregate MNL model, representing the “average” or mainstream consumer segment.\nClass 2 exhibits amplified sensitivity to promotions, suggesting that these individuals are especially responsive to store advertisements or featured product placements.\nClass 3 demonstrates atypical behavior, showing a negative reaction to promotions and a preference for higher-priced options. This counterintuitive pattern may reflect a niche group of consumers, potential outliers, or issues related to data sparsity and overfitting within that segment.\n\nThese findings underscore the value of latent class modeling in surfacing complex and diverse decision-making patterns that a single, population-level model might obscure. However, this added flexibility comes with responsibilities:\n\nInterpretation must be handled with care, especially for small or extreme segments where model estimates may be unstable.\nResearchers should ensure that classes are robust and reproducible, potentially validating them with external data or follow-up surveys.\n\nUltimately, the LC-MNL framework transforms consumer modeling from a one-size-fits-all lens into a segmentation-driven approach, offering deeper insights for targeting, pricing strategies, and promotional design."

The LC-MNL model enhances the standard Multinomial Logit (MNL) approach by accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in consumer preferences. While the MNL model assumes a homogeneous population where all individuals share the same utility parameters, the LC-MNL model allows for multiple latent (hidden) classes of decision-makers, each with distinct choice behaviors.\nBy segmenting individuals into these latent classes, we can capture varying sensitivities to product attributes, such as price and promotional features, providing a richer understanding of consumer behavior.\n\n\nThe utility that individual \\(n\\) derives from choosing alternative \\(j\\) within class \\(s\\) is modeled as:\n\\[\nU_{nj}^{(s)} = X_{nj}'\\beta_s + \\varepsilon_{nj}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(X_{nj}\\) is a vector of observed attributes for alternative \\(j\\) as faced by individual \\(n\\),\n\\(\\beta_s\\) is a vector of class-specific coefficients for class \\(s\\),\n\\(\\varepsilon_{nj}\\) is an idiosyncratic error term assumed to follow an i.i.d. Gumbel distribution.\n\nEach individual has a probability \\(\\pi_s\\) of belonging to latent class \\(s\\), such that:\n\\[\n\\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\pi_s = 1\n\\]\nThe unconditional probability that individual \\(n\\) chooses alternative \\(j\\) is computed by integrating over all classes:\n\\[\nP_{nj} = \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\pi_s \\cdot \\frac{\\exp(X_{nj}'\\beta_s)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{J} \\exp(X_{nk}'\\beta_s)}\n\\]\nThis formulation allows each class to have its own set of preferences, with the class membership probabilities \\(\\pi_s\\) acting as mixture weights.\n\n\n\nTo capture unmeasured factors that systematically affect utility for certain products, we include Alternative-Specific Constants (ASCs) in our utility specification. ASCs reflect inherent preferences for each product, above and beyond observed features such as price or promotional display. The utility function becomes:\n\\[\nU_{nj} = ASC_j + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{price}_{nj} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{featured}_{nj} + \\varepsilon_{nj}\n\\]\nHere:\n\n\\(ASC_j\\) is the constant for alternative \\(j\\), omitted for one base product to avoid perfect multicollinearity,\n\\(\\text{price}_{nj}\\) is the price per ounce of the product,\n\\(\\text{featured}_{nj}\\) is a binary indicator of whether the product was on promotion.\n\nASCs capture relative preferences between products when all other observed attributes are held constant.\n\n\n\nThe yogurt dataset includes:\n\nid: An anonymized identifier for each consumer,\ny1–y4: Indicators denoting the yogurt product chosen during each purchase instance,\np1–p4: Prices of the four yogurt products (in price-per-ounce),\nf1–f4: Binary indicators for whether each product was “featured” (i.e., on promotional display) during the purchase.\n\nFor example, if a consumer with ID 1 purchased yogurt product 4 at a price of $0.079 per ounce and none of the yogurts were promoted, this would be encoded by setting y4 = 1, p4 = 0.079, and all f1 to f4 equal to 0.\nThis dataset structure allows us to analyze how consumers trade off price and promotional status when making their yogurt choices—and how these tradeoffs differ across latent segments of the population.\n\n\n\nBy estimating a latent class MNL model, we aim to:\n\nIdentify distinct consumer segments based on their price sensitivity and responsiveness to promotions,\nQuantify heterogeneity in preferences across these latent segments,\nImprove predictive performance relative to a standard MNL model by accommodating unobserved preference variation.\n\nThe next sections will cover data preprocessing, model estimation, and interpretation of results.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nyog_data = pd.read_csv('yogurt_data.csv')\nyog_data.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\np1\np2\np3\np4\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.081\n0.061\n0.079\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.064\n0.075\n\n\n2\n3\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n3\n4\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n4\n5\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.125\n0.098\n0.049\n0.079\n\n\n5\n6\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.092\n0.050\n0.079\n\n\n6\n7\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.103\n0.081\n0.049\n0.079\n\n\n7\n8\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.086\n0.054\n0.079\n\n\n8\n9\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.050\n0.079\n\n\n9\n10\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.050\n0.079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will first reshape this dataset from wide to long format\n\n## Reshape dataset \n# Reshape dataset \nyog_data = pd.wide_to_long(yog_data,\n                          stubnames=['y', 'f', 'p'],\n                          i='id',\n                          j='product',\n                          sep='',\n                          suffix='[1-4]').reset_index()\n\n# Rename columns for clarity\nyog_data = yog_data.rename(columns={\n    'y': 'chosen',\n    'f': 'featured',\n    'p': 'price'\n})\nyog_data.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nproduct\nchosen\nfeatured\nprice\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n2\n3\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n3\n4\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n4\n5\n1\n0\n0\n0.125\n\n\n5\n6\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n6\n7\n1\n0\n0\n0.103\n\n\n7\n8\n1\n0\n0\n0.108\n\n\n8\n9\n1\n1\n0\n0.108\n\n\n9\n10\n1\n1\n0\n0.108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above reshaped data, each row represents a consumer–product combination with with data about if the product was chosen by the consumer, if the product was featured abd the price per ounce for that product.\n\n\n\nBefore implementing more advanced models such as Latent Class MNL, we begin by fitting a standard Multinomial Logit (MNL) model using the yogurt dataset. This serves as a useful benchmark and helps build foundational understanding of how product attributes influence consumer choices.\nTo estimate the MNL model, we use a long-format (reshaped) dataset where each row represents an alternative within a choice situation. The model will estimate the probability of each alternative being chosen, given its attributes (e.g., price and featured status).\n\n\n\nWhen using libraries such as statsmodels in Python, Alternative-Specific Constants (ASCs) are not automatically generated from categorical variables such as product identifiers. Unlike R packages (e.g., mlogit) which handle these internally, in Python we must explicitly create dummy variables to account for baseline preferences across alternatives.\nTo incorporate ASCs in our model, we perform the following steps:\n\n\nWe begin by transforming the product identifier into dummy variables using one-hot encoding. Each product is represented as a binary column indicating its presence in the current row.\nTo avoid the dummy variable trap (perfect multicollinearity), we drop one of the product columns—typically for product 1—and treat it as the reference category. The resulting dummies become proxies for ASCs. They measure how much more or less preferred each product is compared to the base alternative, after controlling for observed features like price and promotion.\nWithout ASCs, the MNL model would incorrectly assume that all products are equally attractive when their observable attributes are the same, which is often unrealistic in real-world markets.\n\n\n\nOnce the dummy variables are created, we append them to the original dataset. These columns are now part of the explanatory variables used in the MNL estimation. Together with price and featured, these product dummies allow us to model both measurable and inherent product appeal.\nThis setup results in a model specification of the form:\n\\[\nU_{nj} = ASC_j + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{price}_{nj} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{featured}_{nj} + \\varepsilon_{nj}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(ASC_j\\) is the dummy variable for product \\(j\\) (excluding the base category),\n\\(\\text{price}_{nj}\\) is the price per ounce of alternative \\(j\\) for individual \\(n\\),\n\\(\\text{featured}_{nj}\\) is a binary variable indicating whether the product was on promotion.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we present the Python code that performs these steps—generating one-hot encoded product variables and merging them with the dataset. This prepares the data for estimation using a discrete choice modeling package such as statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model.MNLogit or pylogit.\n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n\nencoder = OneHotEncoder(drop='first', sparse_output=False)\nproduct_dummies = encoder.fit_transform(yog_data[['product']])\n\n# Create DataFrame with appropriate column names\nproduct_dummies_df = pd.DataFrame(product_dummies, columns=encoder.get_feature_names_out())\n\n# Merge dummies with main data\nyog_data = pd.concat([yog_data.reset_index(drop=True), product_dummies_df.reset_index(drop=True)], axis=1)\nproduct_dummies_df\n\n# Define independent variables (price, featured, and ASCs)\nX = yog_data[['price', 'featured'] + list(product_dummies_df.columns)]\nX = sm.add_constant(X)  # Add intercept\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconst\nprice\nfeatured\nproduct_2\nproduct_3\nproduct_4\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.0\n0.108\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n1\n1.0\n0.108\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2\n1.0\n0.108\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n3\n1.0\n0.108\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n4\n1.0\n0.125\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n9715\n1.0\n0.086\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n\n\n9716\n1.0\n0.086\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n\n\n9717\n1.0\n0.086\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n\n\n9718\n1.0\n0.086\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n\n\n9719\n1.0\n0.079\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n9720 rows × 6 columns\n\n\n\nThe independent variables for the model includes:\n\nprice: price per ounce\nfeatured: whether the product was promoted\nproduct_2, product_3, product_4: dummy variables representing ASCs for products 2, 3, and 4 (product 1 is the reference)\n\n\n# Dependent variable: whether the product was chosen (1 if chosen, 0 otherwise)\ntarget = yog_data['chosen']\ntarget\n\n0       0\n1       0\n2       0\n3       0\n4       0\n       ..\n9715    1\n9716    1\n9717    1\n9718    1\n9719    1\nName: chosen, Length: 9720, dtype: int64\n\n\nThe above data is our dependent variable.\n\n# Fit the Multinomial Logit model\nmodel = sm.MNLogit(target, X)\nresult = model.fit()\n\n# Show model summary\nresult.summary()\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.477971\n         Iterations 7\n\n\n\nMNLogit Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

Rather than arbitrarily choosing a number of classes, we systematically estimate models with varying class counts—typically 2, 3, 4, and 5—and compare them using a formal model selection criterion.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate and compare the fitted models, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), a widely used metric that balances goodness-of-fit with model complexity. The BIC for a model is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nBIC = -2 \\cdot \\ell_n + k \\cdot \\log(n)\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n( _n ) is the log-likelihood of the model evaluated at convergence,\n( n ) is the number of observations in the dataset,\n( k ) is the total number of estimated parameters in the model.\n\nThe BIC penalizes models for having a large number of parameters, discouraging overfitting. While models with more classes typically achieve higher log-likelihood values, this improvement must be large enough to offset the BIC penalty incurred by additional complexity.\n\n\n\nIn LC-MNL models, each additional latent class introduces:\n\nA new set of class-specific utility parameters (e.g., price and promotion coefficients),\nAn additional class probability parameter (subject to a sum-to-one constraint).\n\nAs a result, the parameter count grows quickly with each added class. Although this flexibility may enhance model fit, it can also lead to overfitting, particularly if some latent classes capture noise rather than meaningful segments of behavior.\nThe BIC is specifically designed to mitigate this risk. It rewards models that strike a good balance between fit and simplicity. A lower BIC value indicates a better model, with the preferred number of classes being the one that minimizes the BIC across all candidate models.\n\n\n\nThe typical workflow for selecting the optimal number of latent classes is as follows:\n\nEstimate LC-MNL models for 2, 3, 4, and 5 classes using maximum likelihood estimation.\nCompute BIC for each model using the formula above.\nCompare BIC values across models to identify the lowest score.\nSelect the model with the minimum BIC as the optimal latent class solution.\n\nThis procedure provides a principled way to uncover meaningful consumer segments without relying on arbitrary assumptions about how many classes exist.\nThe following section will walk through the estimation and comparison process using actual yogurt purchase data.\n\nresults = []\nfor K in range(2, 6):\n    print(f\"Estimating model for {K} classes...\")\n    res = lc_mnl(K, yog_data)\n    results.append(res)\n    #print(f\"Estimated parameters for K = {K}:\")\n    #print(res[\"Parameters\"])\n\nbic = pd.DataFrame(results).sort_values(by='BIC')\n\nEstimating model for 2 classes...\nEstimating model for 3 classes...\nEstimating model for 4 classes...\nEstimating model for 5 classes...\n\n\n\nbic[['K', 'LogLikelihood', 'NumParams', 'BIC']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\nLogLikelihood\nNumParams\nBIC\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\n-8802.938460\n29\n17831.950671\n\n\n1\n3\n-8941.863060\n17\n18016.252112\n\n\n2\n4\n-9530.346287\n23\n19239.992444\n\n\n0\n2\n-10505.614448\n11\n21096.981007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model with the lowest BIC is selected as the best-fitting model when balancing accuracy and simplicity. In our results, the 3-class model had the lowest BIC, suggesting that it best explains the data while avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\n\nNow we compare the parameter estimates between (1) the aggregate MNL, and (2) the latent-class MNL with the number of classes suggested by the BIC.\n\nlc_mnl_3class_params = results[[res[\"K\"] for res in results].index(3)][\"Parameters\"].reset_index()\nlc_mnl_3class_params.columns\nclass3_params = lc_mnl_3class_params.loc[lc_mnl_3class_params['index'].str.contains('_class3')]\nprint(\"Class 3 parameter estimates\")\nprint(class3_params)\n\nClass 3 parameter estimates\n             index        Value  Active bound  Rob.

It reveals that, on average, consumers display moderate sensitivity to price and a positive response to promotional features. However, this summary masks the diverse and nuanced preferences that exist across individuals.\nIn contrast, the Latent Class MNL (LC-MNL) model, particularly with three latent classes, reveals substantial heterogeneity in how consumers make trade-offs:\n\nClass 1 closely mirrors the behavior identified in the aggregate MNL model, representing the “average” or mainstream consumer segment.\nClass 2 exhibits amplified sensitivity to promotions, suggesting that these individuals are especially responsive to store advertisements or featured product placements.\nClass 3 demonstrates atypical behavior, showing a negative reaction to promotions and a preference for higher-priced options. This counterintuitive pattern may reflect a niche group of consumers, potential outliers, or issues related to data sparsity and overfitting within that segment.\n\nThese findings underscore the value of latent class modeling in surfacing complex and diverse decision-making patterns that a single, population-level model might obscure. However, this added flexibility comes with responsibilities:\n\nInterpretation must be handled with care, especially for small or extreme segments where model estimates may be unstable.\nResearchers should ensure that classes are robust and reproducible, potentially validating them with external data or follow-up surveys.\n\nUltimately, the LC-MNL framework transforms consumer modeling from a one-size-fits-all lens into a segmentation-driven approach, offering deeper insights for targeting, pricing strategies, and promotional design."

    "text": "K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n\nIntuition and Workflow\nThe K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, instance-based learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates on a simple yet powerful premise: similar observations tend to have similar outcomes.\nTo classify a new observation ( x_{} ), the algorithm follows these steps:\n\nCompute distances between ( x_{} ) and all training data points ( x_i ), typically using metrics such as Euclidean or Manhattan distance.\nIdentify the ( k ) nearest neighbors — that is, the ( k ) training points with the smallest distances to ( x_{} ).\nDetermine the majority class among these neighbors. The most frequent label becomes the predicted class for ( x_{} ).\n\nThis approach is highly intuitive and adaptive. It makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making it well-suited for complex or irregular decision boundaries. However, its performance can be sensitive to:\n\nThe choice of ( k ),\nThe scaling of features,\nThe presence of irrelevant or noisy variables.\n\nIn the sections that follow, we will apply KNN to classify consumer segments, evaluate performance using cross-validation, and visualize decision boundaries to better understand its behavior in high-dimensional space.\n\n\nEuclidean Distance: Measuring Similarity in Feature Space\nAt the heart of the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm lies the concept of distance. To determine how similar two data points are, we often use the Euclidean distance, a standard and intuitive metric that corresponds to the straight-line distance between two points in space.\nGiven two feature vectors\n( x = (x_1, x_2, , x_d) ) and\n( z = (z_1, z_2, , z_d) ),\nthe Euclidean distance between them is computed as:\n\\[\nd(x, z) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - z_1)^2 + (x_2 - z_2)^2 + \\cdots + (x_d - z_d)^2}\n\\]\nIn the special case where each observation lies in two-dimensional space (i.e., two features), the formula simplifies to:\n\\[\nd((x_1, x_2), (z_1, z_2)) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - z_1)^2 + (x_2 - z_2)^2}\n\\]\nThis distance metric quantifies how “close” two points are in the feature space and directly drives the neighbor selection process in KNN.\n\n\n\nDecision Rule in KNN Classification\nOnce the distances are computed, KNN identifies the ( k ) most similar (i.e., nearest) training instances and bases its prediction on their labels. Let ( _k(x) ) represent the set of indices for the ( k ) nearest neighbors of point ( x ). Then the predicted class label ( ) is given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_{c \\in \\{0,1\\}} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}_k(x)} \\mathbb{1}(y_i = c)\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n( (y_i = c) ) is an indicator function that returns 1 if neighbor ( i )’s true label is class ( c ), and 0 otherwise.\nThe sum counts how many of the ( k ) neighbors belong to class ( c ).\nThe predicted class is the one with the highest vote.\n\nThis majority voting mechanism is simple yet powerful, especially when decision boundaries are irregular or nonlinear.\n\n\n\nHow to Choose the Right Value of ( k )\nThe choice of ( k ) significantly impacts the model’s behavior and performance:\n\nSmall values of ( k ) (e.g., ( k = 1 )) can lead to high variance. The model may fit tightly to noise or outliers, resulting in overfitting.\nLarger values of ( k ) lead to smoother decision boundaries by incorporating a broader neighborhood, which may underfit if the class distributions are not well-separated.\nOptimal ( k ) is typically determined using cross-validation, where different values of ( k ) are evaluated on held-out data to identify the best-performing option.\n\nThere is no universal best value — it must be tuned based on the dataset and the task at hand.\n\n\n\nPractical Walkthrough: KNN on Synthetic Data\nTo better understand how KNN operates, we will conduct an illustrative example using a synthetic dataset. This controlled setting will help us visualize how KNN makes decisions in a two-dimensional feature space.\nIn particular, we will:\n\nGenerate synthetic data with two continuous features, x1 and x2, and a binary response y.\nDefine a nonlinear decision boundary: Class membership will depend on whether a point lies above or below a sinusoidal curve — creating a challenging pattern for classification.\nImplement KNN from scratch, exploring how the algorithm reacts to different values of ( k ).\nCompare our custom implementation with built-in classifiers from popular Python libraries.\nEvaluate and visualize performance, demonstrating how accuracy and boundary flexibility evolve with changes in ( k ).\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Generate data\nnp.random.seed(42)\nn = 100\nx1 = np.random.uniform(-3, 3, n)\nx2 = np.random.uniform(-3, 3, n)\n\nboundary = np.sin(4 * x1) + x1\ny = (x2 &gt; boundary).astype(int)\n\nrandom_df = pd.DataFrame({'x1': x1, 'x2': x2, 'y': y})\nrandom_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx1\nx2\ny\n\n\n\n\n0\n-0.752759\n-2.811425\n0\n\n\n1\n2.704286\n0.818462\n0\n\n\n2\n1.391964\n-1.113864\n0\n\n\n3\n0.591951\n0.051424\n0\n\n\n4\n-2.063888\n2.445399\n1\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n95\n-0.037226\n-0.904743\n0\n\n\n96\n0.136397\n1.355734\n1\n\n\n97\n-0.434754\n2.382662\n1\n\n\n98\n-2.847485\n2.322519\n1\n\n\n99\n-2.352651\n1.679253\n1\n\n\n\n\n100 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nWe can visualize the dataset in 2D, using color to represent the binary class (y).
